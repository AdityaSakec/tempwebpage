Any such loss on account of such squaring up will be solely borne and paid by me/us.</li>
                <li>I/We agree and acknowledge that any instruction given by me/us before the cut off time as may be intimated by MFI to me/us from time to time would be processed on the same day.

Provided however that the MFI shall in exceptional circumstances including on account of any technical snag and/or failure in the system extend the processing time accordingly with prior intimation of such exceptional circumstances to me/us.</li>
                <li>I/We shall be bound by circulars/notices issued by the regulatory authorities including designated Stock Exchanges/SEBI from time to time and I/we are aware that the units of the schemes shall be allotted and/or redeemed, as the case may be, as per the Exchange guidelines in force and the terms of the Scheme, as applicable.</li>
                <li>MFI shall not be liable for any loss, consequential or otherwise, that may arise to me/us as a result of the incorrect NAV as displayed / applied on units allotted to me/us by the Exchange / Mutual Fund etc.</li>
                <li>I/We hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree to pay charges/fees as per the MFI's schedule of charges/fees, including any change in the schedule of charges that may be notified by the MFI from time to time.

                <li>Any tax implication arising out of any transactions entered into pursuant to these terms and conditions would be as per the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961, or any modification or re-enactment thereof.</li>
                <li>These terms and conditions will always be read and construed in conjunction with the mandatory rights and obligations (including non-mandatory obligations, if any) entered into between MFI and me/us.</li>
                <li>MFI has the absolute discretion to amend and/or supplement any of the terms and conditions at any time and MFI will endeavor to give prior notice of the same by email or by displaying the amended Terms and Conditions on the Website or in any manner, it may deem fit, and such amended terms and conditions will apply to and be binding on us/me. I/We hereby confirm that this is an “execution-only” transaction without any interaction or advice by the employee/relationship manager/sales person of the above distributor or notwithstanding the advice of inappropriateness, if any, provided by the employee/relationship manager/sales person of the distributor/MFI and the distributor/MFI has not charged any advisory fees on this transaction.</li>
